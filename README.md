Every time you come across a new recipe and decide to prepare it, the list of ingredients that are required are usually overwhelming. Most of them are not currently available at home. So either you rush to a nearby grocery store or switch to another recipe. Very often, you may end up making nothing or decide to dine out. All in all, cooking has become a tedious job for beginners.
